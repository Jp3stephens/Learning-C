Objective - Learn C very well. This is a foundation for all other programming I will be doing for the rest of my life. 

	- Important to know C because it is low level and to really perfect programming, I should know how EVERYTHING (down to the hardware of the computer) works. C will teach me this. 
	- Projects 
		- Build OS
	
	- Ways to Learn - 
		- https://www.dipmat.univpm.it/~demeio/public/the_c_programming_language_2.pdf
		- Read and program the code examples
		- Also websites in chrome bookmark 'Code self-learn -> C'
		

The hard truth: I slacked off freshman and sophomore year (not doing hw, copying hw, not programming and now I must teach myself to be a good programmer. This means I need to work extra hard on my own time to learn. C will be a tool to do this. 
	Specifically need to learn:
		- Data structures
		- Working with pointers and references
		- Manipulating bits
		- Working with API's
		- Algorithms
		- Programming in general (which comes from programming more)
